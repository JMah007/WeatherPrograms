#Weather Analysis Programs

#Description

####This project focuses on creating suitable test cases involving both black and white box concepts.
Throughout the design process I had to follow software design principles such as modularity and adaptability to 
ensure the program is as efficient and simple as possible.

##Scenario A
Finding the season of the year when a country name and the month of the year is given.

## How to Run the Code Scenario A
#### 1. To compile the program enter "javac MainSeasons.java"
#### 2. Run the program by entering "java MainSeasons"
#### 3. Choose a method of data input or exit (Enter 1, 2 or 3)
#### 4. If one is selected, the data will be displayed to you and you can choose to use the program again. If two is selected, enter a country name from the ones shown then enter a month of the year and the data will be displayed to you and you can hcoose to use the program again. If three is selected the program will end.

##Scenario B 
Finding whether a given temperate reading is above or below the average temperature of a
city (Morning or Evening) will be provided by the system. If the difference is more than 5‚Å∞C,
additional message also will be provided.

## How to Run the Code Scenario B
#### 1. To compile the program enter "javac MainWeather.java"
#### 2. Run the program by entering "java MainWeather"
#### 3. Choose a method of data input or exit (Enter 1, 2 or 3)
#### 4. If one is selected the data will be displayed to you and you can choose to use the program again. If two is selected, enter the name of the city from one of the ones shown then enter a temperature of choice andd the data will be displayed to you and you can choose to use the program again. If three is selected then the program will end.
